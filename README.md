Computational Physics Course Assignments (Spring 2023)

All exercises are written in Python 3. Each exercise has a Jupyter Notebook of its own.

## Topics:
1. Fractals (Koch Snowflake, Heighway Dragon, Sierpi≈Ñski triangle and Khayyam-Pascal triangle)
2. Barnsley Fern, Julia Set, Random Ballistic Deposition
3. Random Ballistic Deposition, Pin-Like Competitive Ballistic Deposition
4. Percolation
5. Random Walk, Diffusion-Limited Aggregation
6. Random Number Generators, Central Limit Theorem, Monte Carlo Sampling
7. The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
8. The Ising Model
9. First Order and Second Order Differential Equations (Euler, Euler-Cromer, Leapfrog, Verlet, Velocity Verlet, Beeman)
10. Chaos (Bifurcation Diagram)
11. Molecular Dynamics (2D Simulation of Argon Atoms with Lennard-Jones Potential)
12. The Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithm
